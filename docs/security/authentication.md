# Overview

Authentication is the process of verifying users that wish to access your Cluster or application.

With Temporal, there are several authentication protocols that can be set to restrict access to your data. These protocols address three different areas: servers, client connections, and users.

# Authentication Target Areas

## Servers

Servers can fall victim to spoofing and MITM attacks. To prevent these, specify the `serverName` in the `client` section of your mTLS configuration.

This enables established connections to authenticate the endpoint. This means that the server certificate that is presented to a connecting client has the given the server name.

Server configuration can be accomplished on `internode` and `frontend` endpoints.

For more information on configuring authentication for your server, refer to the [`samples-server` repository](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/master/tls).

## Client Connections

Client connections can be restricted to certain endpoints. These clients would need certificates issued by a specific Certificate Authority.

Specify the certificates allowed by modifying the `clientCaFiles`/ `clientCaData` and `requireClientAuth` properties. These properties are found in the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the mTLS configuration.

## Users

User access can be restricted through extensibility points and plugins. When implemented, the `frontend` invokes the plugin before executing the requested operation.

Temporal offers two plugin interfaces for user authentication via API call:

- ['ClaimMapper'](/docs/security/what-is-claimmapper)
- ['Authorizer'](/docs/security/what-is-authorizer)

These plugins are adapatable to a variety of use cases and identity schemes.

See the [`samples-server` repository](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/blob/main/extensibility/authorizer) for a sample integration of the `Authorizer` plugin.
